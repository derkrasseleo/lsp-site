<p>
	Vladimir Sadovnikov is the founder and the main developer of the LSP project from Saint Petersburg, Russia.
	For over than ten years he became an experienced software developer with knowledge of x86 Assembly, C, C++, Perl and Java languages.
	Beside the programming he is an extreme-style guitar player specialized on wide range of Heavy Metal styles, extreme vocalist, composer and non-professional sound engineer.
	After he became a GNU/Linux user and developer, he started to explore sound processing under GNU/Linux and met lack of some useful software.
	Due to the fact that not all his patches to open-source projects were accepted by their communities and the demand of these patches by other people is evident, he decided to start
	his own project where these patches could become new independent life after some correction and refactoring.

<p>
	Boris, bor-T, the former Windows-addictive, now user of Linux from Moldova.
	In the beginning of 2020 got familiar with LSP Plugins and found
	frequent application of them in his own projects. Noticed the
	superb quality of sound but found the UI too motley. Once has met
	a comment of Vladimir that anyone who has experience with XML
	can help with creation of new UI. Because Boris already had some
	experience with XML (actually heard somewhere about this format) previously, he got in touch with Vladimir in october 2020.
	The main work specialization is a tattooist and artist since 2004.
	Self-educated. Some time was experienced with web design and
	graphics. As a hobby, is involved with creation of electronic
	music in such styles like Drum and Bass and Minimal Techno.
	Since 2002 and up to 2011 was engaged in writing beats and 
	creating tracks of the Rap style.
	Takes part in LSP Project as an UI and UX designer. In the future
	has plans to get more knowledge about programming and become more useful to the project.
